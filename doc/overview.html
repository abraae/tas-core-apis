<h1>Overview</h1>


<p>Talent App Store is an open, vendor-neutral, multi-tenanted cloud API platform
where customers can click to install pre-integrated SaaS talent management apps.</p>

<h1>What is TAS?</h1>

<p>To you, as the developer of a talent management app, Talent App Store acts as:

<ul>
<li><b>A sales channel.</b> Hundreds of customers are already using TAS, making thousands of API endpoints available. If you have a product that solves some talent management problem better than anyone else, you now have access to a ready market who can instantly trial your product with a single click.
<li><b>A provisioning service.</b> TAS calls an API on your app to tell you in real time when new tenants install or uninstall your app. You respond to the provisioning API by inserting a row into your customer table, assigning a trained simian to start installing a server, or whatever.
<li><b>An SSO (Single Sign On) service.</b> If your app presents a web user interface, then TAS handles logins to your app in a highly secure, customer-controlled way, and integrates tightly with customer-supplied identity providers via SAML 2.0. SAML support and SSO is increasing understood by customers to be a key part of an integrated talent management experience. TAS handles all of the heavy lifting of SSO and SAML for you, and removes you from the risky business of managing user authentication.
<li><b>An API directory service.</b> TAS provides APIs for your app to dynamically locate API endpoints on other apps, based on the tenant's latest installation choices. For example, your app simply locates and then calls the GET /jobs endpoint, without needing to know which app is currently producing that endpoint. If the customer swaps out their ATS and replaces it with another, your app continues calling GET /jobs without interruption.
<li><b>An API authentication service.</b> TAS provides access tokens and credentials for apps to call each others APIs securely, with user identity available to all endpoints.
<li><b>An app lifecycle service.</b> TAS sends your app tenant-specific signals so that it can  shut down and start up cleanly as tenants make changes to their configuration (e.g. installing and uninstalling apps).
<li><b>A demo packaging service.</b> With TAS, you can define shopping lists of microservices
that support your app, such as databases of demo jobs, org structures, and wrap these around
your app. Customers can install your app as a part of a complete, functioning technology stack,
trial it, and then swap out the demo apps in the stack for real apps connected to their existing
talent management platform.
</ul>
</p>

<p>There are also some things that TAS is not:
<ul>
<li>TAS is not an IaaS or a hosting platform. You host your apps yourself on your own infrastructure.
<li>TAS is not a programming language or a framework. You can write your apps in your language of choice, using whatever user interface framework you favour and storing your data in your chosen database. TAS helps you to communicate with other apps, and with TAS itself, via http-based REST APIs. TAS does provide a set of Java client libraries to help with writing apps.
<li>TAS is not an ESB (Enterprise Service Bus). API traffic does not flow through any TAS servers. Instead, your app uses TAS to locate an API endpoint and obtain an access token. The actual API call is made directly from your app (the consumer) to the other app (the producer) over the internet, and not through TAS. TAS is not a bottleneck or a point of failure.
</ul>

<h1>How it works</h1>

<h2>Multitenant architecture</h2>

[diagram]


<h1>API types in TAS</h1>

<p>Within a single tenant, most of the action takes place when apps call APIs on other apps. We call these <b>tenant APIs</b>.
As much as possible, TAS helps apps get set up to make tenant API calls to each other, then stays out of the way.</p>

<p>Tenant APIs are business-oriented, like fetching the current list of open jobs.</p>

<p>TAS itself also provides some <b>core APIs</b> that support meta functionality, like notifying your app that it has a new
tenant, stopping and starting apps, locating API endpoints, etc.</p>

<p>Core API calls are either inwards (where your app calls an endpoint on TAS) or
outwards (where TAS calls an endpoint on the <b>control server</b> of your app).</p>

<b>Core and tenant APIs in Talent App Store</b>

Social sharing app->TAS:
Career site app->ATS app:tenant API call, e.g. GET /openJobs
Social sharing app->ATS app:tenant API call, e.g. GET /openJobs/{id}
</div>


<h2>Tenant APIs</h2>

<p>Tenant APIs are made from one app (the <b>consumer</b>) in the store to another (the <b>producer</b>).</p>

<p>For example, a job board app might call <b>GET /jobs</b> to obtain a list of currently open jobs.</p>

<p>Tenant API calls are always within the context of a single tenant. An app working on behalf of one tenant can never make a tenant API call to an app working on behalf of a diferent tenant. TAS provides no facilities for communicating between tenants.</p> 

<h3>Tenant API transport</h3>

<p>Tenant API calls flow directly from one app to another over the internet, and do not pass through TAS itself.
Once the consumer and producer are set up, any number - even thousands - of tenant API calls can be made without any traffic to TAS itself,
and without the need for any TAS API calls. This makes TAS extremely scalable and resilient, and greatly reduces the chance of TAS
becoming a bottleneck or point of failure.</p>

<h3>Tenant API namespacing</h3>

<p>TAS is an open, vendor-neutral platform where all apps are equal, and where any tenant API can be produced or consumed by any app.</p>

<p>Any developer is free to add their own tenant APIs to TAS (subject to the TAS terms of service, which are designed to maintain the
system's integrity, rather than to favour any one developer).
There is no central authority that vets API names, checks for collisions, or otherwise enforces consistency on API naming.</p>

<p>It follows that more than one developer may want to define, say, the /jobs API.</p>

<p>Rather than using a "first in, first served" system, which would be vulnerable to name squatting, in TAS all tenant APIs are
identified not just by their URI, but also by the name of the developer who defined the API. This means there may be multiple
<b>/jobs</b> APIs defined, e.g.:
<ul>
<li><b>&lt;tas&gt;/jobs</b> (defined by Talent App Store Ltd)
<li><b>&lt;smartsoft&gt;/jobs</b> (defined by SmartSoft Corp.)
<li><b>&lt;acme-int&gt;/jobs</b> (defined by Acme Corp.)
</ul>
</p>

<p>In some examples you may see the developer omitted for brevity. But it is always required, i.e. an app does not simply call <b>GET /jobs</b>, it specifically calls <b>GET &lt;tas&gt;/jobs</b>,
or <b>GET &lt;smartsoft&gt;/jobs</b> or whatever.</p>


<h3>TAS is decentralized</h3>

<p>TAS is designed as an entirely decentralized platform. When your app consumes a tenant API, it cannot know by itself which app()s) are producing that API,
because this depends on which apps the tenant currently has installed.</p>

<p>This is quite different to the APIs that you might find provided by a large vendor's system, when
an API call is always either to, or sometimes from, the mothership.</p>

<p>In TAS, there is no mothership. All apps are equal. Any app can produce any API, and any app can consume any API on any other app.
It is even a contractual requirement that any developer defining an API in TAS releases the API under a suitable open source license. The purpose
of this is to minimise any legal impediments to a customer swapping out an app for another that produces the same APIs.</p>

<p>This decentralization is deliberate, with the purpose of giving customers choice, preventing lock-in and making them masters of their own destiny by allowing
them to swap out any app and replace it with another one.</p>


<h3>Locating tenant API endpoints</h3>

<p>The flip side of decentralization is that your app has no way to know how to call GET /jobs, since it does not know which app the
customer (tenant) has installed to produce that API.</p>

<p>Therefore, before calling a tenant API for the first time, your app must use a core API to ask TAS how to make the call.</p>

<p>If your app is written in Java, you will probably use the TAS Java client libraries to hide this complexity (and to provide efficiencies
such as caching endpoint locations and access tokens for as long as possible, clearning them down when the app is cycled, etc.).</p>

<p>However for clarification the process of calling a tenant API is shown below at the raw API level. In this example:
<ul>
<li>On behalf of the tenant acme;
<li>the app "jobsite" wants to call GET &lt;tas&gt;/jobs to get the list of currently open jobs;
<li>GET &lt;tas&gt;/jobs is currently produced by the app "ats";
<li>The ats app uses HMAC authentication for the GET &lt;tas&gt;/jobs API (not basic)
</ul>
</p>

<p>Note: in practice routes should be cached to minimise traffic. Once cached, none of the core API calls shown above would be needed.</p>

note left of ats app: ats verifies HMAC and allows the API call 
</div>


<h3>Tenant API versioning</h3>

<p>The developer who owns a tenant API is in control of that API's definition.</p>

<p>For example, the developer may choose to add an additional field to the APIs response body.</p>

<p>However any changes to an API definition should be made in a non-breaking style.
The following are guidelines as to what this means 
(with thanks to <a href='https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/APIChangeGuidelines'>openstack</a>):</p>

<h4>Generally acceptable</h4>
<ul>
<li>The change is the only way to fix a security bug
<li>Fixing a bug so that a request which resulted in an error response before is now successful
<li>Adding a new response header
<li>Changing an error response code to be more accurate
<li>Adding a property to a resource representation
<li>Adding an optional property to a resource representation which may be supplied by clients, assuming the API previously would ignore this property
</ul>
<h4>Generally not acceptable</h4>
<ul>
<li>A change such that a request which was successful before now results in an error response (unless the success reported previously was hiding an existing error condition)
<li>Changing or removing a property in a resource representation
<li>Changing the semantics of a property in a resource representation which may be supplied by clients
<li>Changing or removing a response header
<li>Changing which response code is returned on success
</ul>

<p>If it is essential that a non-breaking change is made, the owner of the API should instead define a new tenant API.</p>

<h3>Ownership vs use of tenant APIs</h3>

<p>While owning a tenant API gives a developer control over the APIs, it does not provide any contol over who uses the API.
Any developer is free to build an app that produces or consumes any API.<p>

<p>For customers, this provides assurance that they can swap out apps and replace them if they need to
(assuming that a replacement app that produces the same APIs is available).</p>

<p>For developers of apps that consume APIs, this means not being commercially at the mercy of dependant on a single, larger entity.
For example, as the developer of a job board, you can just consume GET &lt;tas&gt;/jobs, without caring which application tracking system
(or any otehr source of open jobs) the tenant has installed. If the tenant swaps out their ATS, your app will keep working, without
any changes.</p> 

<p>As a developer, you are also free to define all your own APIs, rather than use any defined by other developers. Since you own
the APIs, and the apps, this gives you complete control over your own destiny. Of course, unless you can persuade other developers
to also use your APIs, your apps will effectively be an island (or an island chain).</p>  

<h3>Source of Truth APIs</h3>   

<p>In a talent management ecosystem based on microservices, each type of business object such as jobs or job seekers
"belongs" to some app that acts as the single source of truth, aka the master record. That master record app produces API endpoints like GET /jobs
or GET /jobSeekers through which other apps can learn about the definitive set of business objects for a given customer (tenant).<p>

<p>In TAS, tenant APIs like this are called Source of Truth (SoT) APIs. Most tenant APIs are SoT APIs.</p>

<p>Only one app can produce a given SoT API at any one time.</p>

<p>As an app developer, SoT APIs are easier to deal with. If is only one source of truth for jobs, its easy for other apps
to search jobs, report on them and generally manipulate them. An app only has to go to one known place for example to fetch
all open jobs for the tenant.</p>

<p>When an app is installed by a tenant, TAS checks that the app does not violate any SoT APIs. For example, if an app
is installed that produces /jobs, TAS will not allow another app to be installed that also produces /jobs.</p>

<h4>Non-Source of Truth APIs</h4>   

<p>Some tenant APIs are not SoT APIs.</p>

<p>For example, maybe the app holding the definitive set of open jobs needs an API that it can call to alert other
apps that a new job has been posted (this example uses the simple replication convention described elsewhere for its API
signatures).</p>

<p>To do this, the "job master record" app would by convention call an API like this, on every app that wished to be alerted about new jobs:</p>

<div class='codeBlock'>
POST /m/jobs/{}/deltaPings 
</div> 

<p>Because the URI of this API begins with the special sequence "/m" (short for "many"), TAS treats the API as a non-SoT API.</p>

<p>Unlike an app producing a SoT API, TAS will allow any number of apps to be installed that all produce the same non-SoT API.
So if the tenant wants to use 6 separate apps that all keep their own local copy of open jobs (a likely reason why they would
want to be alerted about new open jobs), TAS will allow them all to be installed at the same time.</p>

<p>Consuming non-SoT APIs is harder work for the app  developer.</p>

<p>For example, in the case above, when new job 10223 is created, what happens if the calls to POST /m/jobs/10223/deltaPings
succeeds for the first 2 producing apps, but then fails for the third? Should the app continue on POST-ing to the
remaining 3 apps? These types of questions are harder to answer when an app is consuming an endpoint on many producers.</p>

<h1>API Authentication</h1>


<h2>HMAC authentication</h2>

<p>Most TAS core APIs are protected using HMAC-SHA256 authentication in a similar manner to <a href='http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html'>Amazon Web Service's approach.</a></p>

<p>Essentially, incoming and outgoing core API calls contain an HTTP Authorization header which holds
a message authentication code - a hashed representation of the entire HTTP request.</p>

<p>For incoming core API calls (which are outgoing from the perspective of your app), your app must calculate the MAC and add the Authorization header to the request.</p>

<p>For outgoing core API calls, your app must recalculate the MAC based on the incoming request, and compare it
to the Authorization header found in the request. Your app should only consider the API call valid if the codes match.</p>

<p>The MAC code used depends on the actual API. As described below , there are three different types of key pair managed by TAS. For many APIs, the MAC is calculated
your app's key - the value that is given to you by TAS when you register your app.</p>


<h2>Access hierarchy</h2>

<p>The diagram below shows the 3 different types of key pair (each having a public + private key) held by TAS.</p>

<p>
<table border=1>
<thead>
<tr><td>Key pair</td><td>Held against</td><td>Private key created/updated when?</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>App key</td><td>An app</td><td>When the developer first defines the app in TAS, or asks for the private key to be regenerated</td></tr>
<tr><td>Install key</td><td>An app, installed by a specific tenant</td><td>Whenever the store is cycled</td></tr>
<tr><td>Route key</td><td>The consumption, by a specific consumer (app), of a specific API, at a specific producer (app)</td><td>Whenever the store is cycled</td></tr>
</tbody>

<p>The sequence diagram below shows how security access fans out in TAS. For example:

<ol>
<li>A consumer uses its app key to fetch the routes, and then a token, for a tenant API call
<li>The resulting access token is signed using an install key, which is shorter lived than an app key
</ol>
</p>

<p>Note the JWT that is passed in to POST /patchSetLaunches is signed by the storefront app key, rather than the install key.
That's because the launch is creating a store/tenant.

<h3>Tenant API authentication</h3>

<p>There are two types of authentication on tenant APIs - OAuth and non-OAuth.<p>

<p>No matter which authentication type is used, the general principle is that TAS provides the credentials
to the consumer app (so that it can prepare an HTTP Authorization header) and to the producer app (so that
it can validate incoming requests against the credentials).</p>

<p>Except for basic authentication, TAS generates these credentials automatically, and scopes them down
as tightly as possible. So for example, TAS will generate an HMAC signing key that is valid for:

<ul>
<li>a specific consumer;
<li>of a specific API;
<li>at a specific producer;
<li>until a specific expiry time
</ul>

<p>..and will provide that key to both the consumer and the producer of the API.</p>

<h4>OAuth APIs</h4>

<p>OAuth APIs are more powerful that non-OAuth, as they can be used to obtain the logged in user's identity. The identity
can be carried down through a chain of OAuth API calls, allowing each app to enforce its own business rules and provide
the right data based on the user's identity (and their roles, location within org structure, etc.).</p>

<p>TAS OAuth access tokens are self-contained Java Web Tokens (http://jwt.io/), created by TAS and signed with the tenant's
secret key. TAS never makes the tenant secret key available to anyone. Because tokens are self-contained,
API producers can validate incoming access tokens themselves using the tenant's public key - there is no need for the
API producer (the resource server in OAuth parlance) to use the services of the authorization server (TAS) for this.</p>

<p>In other words, TAS needs to be involved to create access tokens, but not to verify them. This helps with scalability.</p> 

<p>TAS's OAuth authentication is fully described in the RAML documentation.</p>

<p>The flow involved in making tenant API calls is more complex, since user-specific access tokens need to be obtained.</p>

<b>Sequence of events - one app calling the OAuth tenant API "/userPreferences/{email}" on another app. There is a business rule
associated with /userPreferences/{email} that users can only see their own preferences, hence this needs to be an OAuth API
in order to make user identity available.</b>

note left of preferences app: token is OK, preferences app now performs\nadditional tests, e.g. aud == 'preferences',\ninc == tenant.incarnation
note left of preferences app: allows the API call 
</div>

 

<h4>Non-OAuth APIs</h4>

<p>Non-OAuth APIs are further broken down into HMAC and basic authentication. HMAC is preferred, and is more secure.
Basic auth should not be used by new apps, but only where the app is fronting a legacy system already using basic authentication.</p>

<p>TAS's HMAC and basic authentication is fully described in the RAML documentation.</p>


<h1>App lifecycle</h1>

[incomplete]


<h1>Principal types and roles</h1>

<p>A principal type is a class of person (or system) that can:
<ul>
<li>log into an TAS SSO-protected app
<li>indirectly call an OAuth protected TAS tenant API
</ul>
</p>

<p>Any TAS app that is SSO-protected or that produces OAuth APIs needs to do so within the context of a specific principal type.</p>

<p>For example:
<ul>
<li>a job board app might be protected by <b>&lt;tas&gt; candidate</b>
<li>a talent pool search app might be protected by <b>&lt;tas&gt; user</b>
<li>an app for sourcing candidates through recruitment agencies might be protected by <b>&lt;tas&gt; agency</b>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>TAS is SAML 2.0-based, so when someone authenticates at your SSO-protected app, your app receives a SAML authentication assertion.

<h2>Identity sources</h2>

<p>As a developer, your SSO-protected app receives incoming SAML assertions about principals (users) as you require them to log in.<p>

<p>Behind the scenes, and based on the tenant's choices, a single principal type may be mapped to multiple <b>identity sources</b>.</p>

<p>For example, the tenant acme may have configured things such that anyone can authenticate as a &lt;tas&gt; candidate if they have:
<ul>
<li>an account in the corporate IdP. Everyone like this gets marked as internal.
<li>an account in the legacy ATS support team. These people all get marked as internal, allowing them to debug internal-facing content issues.
<li>a candidate record in the legacy ATS. These people log in at a dialogue presented by TAS, but the ATS does the password checking. On successful login, the ATS passes through information in json, such as whether candidate is internal. That information gets injected as attributes in the eventual SAML assertion.
<li>a RealMe account. Since acme is an NZ public sector organization, RealMe is allowed. Marked as internal if they have an *@acme.com email.
<li>an email address. Marked as internal if they have an *@acme.com email.
<li>a LinkedIn account. Marked as internal if they have an *@acme.com email. Marked as alumni if they are in a the LinkedIn group 'Official ACME alumni group'
</ul>
</p>

<p>Your app normally would not care about these mappings, or about which identity source a user authenticated through - as far as it is concerned,
all authentications are just candidates, with an associated SAML assertion.</p>  

<b>TODO: Need to finally knock on the head the idea of &gt;1 principal types per app.</b>

<p>An app that is SSO-protected by a particular principal type can consume OAuth APIs
on any other installed app that is protected by the same principal type.</p>

<p>This allows a chain of user-aware API calls through any number of installed apps at the tenant.</p>

<p>For example if the dashboard app <b>compdashboard</b> is SSO-protected by &lt;tas&gt; user, and so is the app <b>payrollblast</b>,
then compdashboard can call OAuth APIs on payrollblast.<p>


<h3>Namespacing by developer</h3>

<p>As with APIs, to prevent name squatting principal types are in the namespace of the developer who defines them.</p>

<p>For example, the developer "tas" has defined these two principal types:
<ul>
<li>&lt;tas&gt; candidate</li>
<li>&lt;tas&gt; user</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>As a developer, you can define your own principal types, e.g.:
<ul>
<li>&lt;supersoft&gt; candidate</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>However doing your own thing means that your new principal type will not be usable by any existing app in TAS.
You would need to write new apps (or persuade others to) that used your principal type.</p>

<p>To get the most adoption for your app, it helps to reuse an existing principal type where possible. For example, if your app uses a common
principal type like &lt;tas&gt; candidate, then many tenants will be able to install your app and have it work straight away, since they
will have already defined the identity sources for &lt;tas&gt; candidate.</p>

<p>It follows too that your app will likely be able to call an API like GET &lt;tas&gt;/candidates to get a list of candidates. This makes your app
 more immediately valuable to customers.</p>


<h1>Storefront apps</h1>

<p>Storefront apps are specially privileged apps that perform actions on TAS itself, like installing apps, adding identity sources, etc.<p>

<p>Storefront apps need to be tagged as "storeFront" by TAS support. Please contact TAS if you want to build a storefront app.</p>

<p>In theory multiple storefront apps can coexist within the same tenant.<p>


<h2>Patching a store</h2>

<p>All changes to a store's configuration - i.e. installs, edits or uninstalls of the apps and identity sources making up the store - 
are made via patch documents (documents that conform to the HTTP PATCH semantics described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902).</p>

<p>As per the RFC, all changes in the patch set are made with a single atomic transaction.</p>

<h3>Additional patch semantics</h3>

<p>TAS supports an additional id-based path style inspired by SCIM (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-scim-api-12), except that EMCA script is used, e.g.:</p>

<p>This path points to the installed app "tas-legacyats".</p>

<div class='codeBlock'>
"path": "installs[app=='tas-legacyats']"
</div>

<h3>Patch examples</h3>

<p>This example updates the baseUri on the "main" server of the installed app "tas-legacyats".</p>

<div class='codeBlock'>
PATCH /{tenant}
[
{ "op": "replace", "path": "installs[app=='tas-legacyats'].servers[name=='main'].baseUri", "value": "https://newlocation.com/api"
]
</div>


<p>This example installs the app "zongo" from the developer "zwarg", after first checking that the store is still at incarnation 23.</p>

<div class='codeBlock'>
PATCH /{tenant}
[
  { "op": "test", "path": "status.incarnation", "value": 23 },
  { "op": "add", "path": "status.installs.-", "value": {"app": "zwarg-zongo"} }
]
</div>

<p>This example installs an app with a server override (i.e., a non-multi tenanted app such as a legacy ATS).</p>

<div class='codeBlock'>
PATCH /{tenant}
[
  { "op": "test", "path": "/incarnation", "value": 23 },
  { "op": "add", "path": "/installs/-", "value": {"app": "tas-legacyats", "servers": [{"name": "ats0", "basicAuthCredentials": {"user": "fred", "password": "secret1"}}]} }
]
</div>

<p>This example changes the password for the previously installed app:</p>

<div class='codeBlock'>
PATCH /{tenant}
[
  { "op": "test", "path": "/incarnation", "value": 23 },
  { "op": "add", "path": "/installs/6/servers/0/basicAuthCredentials/password", "value": "secret2" }
]
</div>

<p>This example sets up a new tenant:
<ol>
<li>creates the store for a new tenant "acme"
<li>installs the storefront app
<li>installs a single identity source for the bootstrap IdP
<li>hardcodes all people in the bootstrap IdP as "hrStoreAppAdmin" and "hrStoreIdentityAdmin", so that they can manage the store.
</ol>
</p>


<div class='codeBlock'>
PATCH /{tenant}
[
{
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/",
    "value": {
        "details": {
            "organizationName": "ACME Corporation",
            "shortCode": "acme",
            "description": "A test site while we see if this stuff works",
            "country": "US",
            "industry": "Manufacturing"
        },
        "installs": [
            {
                "app": "tas-storefront"
            }
        ],
        "identitySourceSets": [
            {
                "principalDeveloper": "tas",
                "principalType": "user",
                "identitySources": [
                    {
                        "kind": "bootstrapIdentitySource",
                        "description": "The store owner automatically gets access to manage the store",
                        "attributeOverrides": [
                            {
                                "filter": "*",
                                "ifMatched": [
                                    {
                                        "name": "tas-user-roles",
                                        "values": [
                                            "hrStoreIdentityAdmin",
                                            "hrStoreAppsAdmin",
                                            "hrStoreViewer"
                                        ]
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
]
</div>

<h2>Applying a patch</h2>

<p>To apply a patch document to a tenant, your storefront app makes a series of API calls, as shown in the example below:<p>

<ol>
<li>The user (an HR admin person) is at the app details page within your storefront web site.</li>
<li>They click install on the app, submitting a web form</li>
<li>Your app's server code composes a patch document based on the user's input.</li>
<li>Your app's server code POSTS to /{tenant}/patchSets, with:
<ol>
<li>the patch document
<li>the continue page, i.e. where the storefront would like the user to end up on completion
</ol>
..and checks for errors.</li>
<li>The response from TAS contains a signed JWT, which embeds the original patch document and the continue page.</li>
<li>Your server code inserts the JWT into the onClick handler of a new "confirm" button on the app details page.</li>
<li>The user is now back at the app details page. They click confirm.</li>
<li>The browser opens a progress dialog.</li>
<li>The browser submits the JWT, including the original patch document, via an ajax call to PATCH /{tenant}.</li>
<li>The call returns immediately with a launch key and the first few items of the patch log.</li>  
<li>The browser writes the patch log to the progress dialog.</li>
<li>The browser immediately makes another ajax call to GET /{tenant}/patchLaunches/{launchKey}
<li>This is a long polling method, which returns as soon as any new patch log items are available.</li>
<li>The browser loops, making repeated ajax calls to GET /{tenant}/patchLaunches/{launchKey} and adding new log messages to the progress dialog, until the operation is complete.</li>
<li>The final response from GET /{tenant}/patchLaunches/{launchKey} includes the URI of the continue page.
<li>The browser displays a "patch complete" message to the user, and a "Continue" button.
<li>On pressing Continue, the user is redirected to the continue page.
<li>We're done.  
</ol> 

<p>The complexity of the interactions, and the use of JWTs, is necessary:
<ul>
<li>to allow the progress dialog to continue throughout, even when
<ul>
<li>the storefront app itself is stopped and started like all other apps as the patch set is applied</li>
<li>the storefront app is swapped out for another one as part of the changes</li>
</ul>
<li>to reflect the insecure nature of making ajax calls from the browser
</ul>

<h2>How TAS applies patch sets</h2>

<p>To apply a patch set, TAS does the following:
<ol>
<li>requests each already installed app to shut down</li>
<li>applies the set</li>
<li>resets all volatile credentials for the tenant:
<ul>
<li>The tenant's own private/public key pair (as obtained via GET /{tenant})
<li>All HMAC signing keys (as held on routes)
</ul>
<li>Increments the tenant's incarnation (thus invalidating all existing OAuth tokens)
<li>detects whether the delta set includes uninstalling the app that created tha launcher, and if
so calls GET /m/storeFrontMainPage to get a new continue page. Note this prevents an about-to-be-uninstalled storefront
from specifying any continue page, not just a page on itself.
<li>sends startup requests to each installed app</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>In parallel to the above, TAS causes any outstanding long polling calls to GET /{tenant}/patchSetLaunches to return
each time there is a new available event. A maximum of 100 events are returned per call.</p>


<h2>Bootstrap patch set</h2>

<p>As well as patching existing tenants, storefront apps can also create new tenants, for example:

<ul>
<li>when a new tenant creates their store
<li>when an existing tenant copies their store (e.g. to create a testing/sandbox site)
</ul>
</p>
 
<p>POST /tenantBootstraps/{tenant}</p>

<p>Once this launch is complete, the storefront app can take over the UI. TAS will call GET /storeFrontMain.</p>


<h1>AuthListener apps</h1>

<p>AuthListener apps are specially privileged apps that listen to all authentications for a tenant, for tasks like auto-provisioning.</p>

<p>AuthListener apps need to be tagged as "authListener" by TAS support. Please contact TAS if you want to build an AuthListener app.</p>

<p>AuthListeners are required because tasks like auto-provisioning require detailed domain knowledge about roles, user types, SAML attribute mappings, etc.</p>

<p>TAS itself does not have any knowledge about these sort of domain-specific issues. It only deals in raw authentications. For example, TAS will know that
a person who is a <b>&lt;tas&gt; candidate</b> has logged in, but it does not understand any concepts specific to that principal type, e.g. whether the candidate is internal, alumni, has some work detail
attached as a SAML attribute, etc. Hence TAS allows authListener apps to gain control at login time, and take domain-specific actions.</p>

<p>In theory multiple authListener apps can coexist within the same tenant.<p>

<h2>Auto-provisioning example </h2>

<p>A typical authListener would be an auto-provisioning app. On someone logging in, TAS calls POST /{tenant}/{principalDeveloper}/{principalType}
on your authListener app, passing through:
<ul>
<li>the raw SAML authentication assertion
<li>the derived samlSubject object (json)
</ul>
</p>

<p>Your app might then (for example):
<ol>
<li>examine the attributes of the incoming SAML assertion
<li>find the firstName attribute, and all other attributes known to make up a candidate
<li>make a SCIM REST call to POST /candidates against the app acting as the source of truth for candidates, e.g. a legacy ATS
</ol>
</p>


<h2>How TAS interacts with authListeners</h2>

<p>When someone logs in, TAS calls the outwards core API POST /{tenant}/{principalDeveloper}/{principalType} on all installed apps tagged with authListener.</p>

<p>TAS will wait until all authListeners have responded with 200 before it passes the login through to the web app, so that any
auto-provisioning type operations are complete by the time the user login hits the web site.</p>


<h2>Identity scenarios</h2>
